#BHA Spectrophotometer

This repo contains the designs and source files of a **DIY Spectrophotometer**. This device, based on the TSL1402R IC, can be used to do a photospectral analysis of liquid samples, such as growth curve analysis. Check out the corresponding [BHA lecture in the Syllabus](http://biohackacademy.github.io) for more information.

##Releases

The BioHack Academy 3 release contains the following:

* 2015 BHA1 Design
* 2015 BHA2 Design
* 2016 BHA3 Design

## To Do

The To Do's are tracked using the Issues section. Please maket more suggestions by posting there.

* Replace the TSL1406R because of obsolescence. Currently testing the [TSL1401CL](https://nl.rs-online.com/web/p/photodetector-arrays/7857692/) as an alternative.
